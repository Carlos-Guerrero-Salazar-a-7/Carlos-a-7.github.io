                <h2>About the event</h2>
                The Roux Academy’s annual conference and exhibit is designed to foster a close-
                knit relationship amongst artists at various universities around the world. But sign
                up early, as this not-to-miss conference sells out quickly, and the waiting list is long.
                In addition, art students are encouraged to send in works from their school
                portfolios to be considered for hanging in the CAC exhibit halls, as well as to be
                selected as a Featured Artist.

                        Sculpture, where he excelled in glass etching paintings and portraiture. Hailed as
                        one of the most diverse artists of his generation, Barot is equally as skilled with
                        watercolors as he is with oils.

and conservation - themes that are central to her heart. LaVonne will share her

foot high wall in the Rousseau Room of Hotel Contempo in front of a standing-

already changing the face of modern art at the university. Riley’s exquisite abstract
pieces have no intention of ever being understood, but instead beg the viewer to
dream, create, pretend, and envision with their mind’s eye. Riley will be speaking
on the “Art of Abstract” during Thursday’s schedule.
