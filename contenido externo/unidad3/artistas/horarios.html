                        his unique technique of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze. This session is sure
                        to be a hit with mixed media buffs.

                <h1>Water in Art</h1>
                Water in Art is the theme for the second day, as art students from around the world
                gather at the Fountain of Intrigue in the gardens of Hotel Contempo to create ice
                sculptures, and art lecturers discuss the use of water as an art material, and water
                as an art subject.

                    <p>
                        Jennifer Jerome, a native of New Orleans, whose work has centered around
                abstract images that depict flooding and rebuilding, will talk about how the floods
                inspired her artistically, and how, despite the sadness of devastation and lives lost,
                her work also depicts the hope and togetherness of a community that has
                persevered.

                        Get on your mittens and earmuffs, and join your fellow artists at the Fountain of
                        Intrigue, in the Hotel Contempo gardens, where the ambient temperature has been
                        turned down to allow the sculpting of ice into the most mysterious and beautiful of
                        shapes. Richard Reed will share his secrets for chiseling ice into a shape that your
                        imagination has envisioned. There is an extra fee of $25 for the rental of the tools
                        needed to sculpt ice, if you plan to participate. And we hope you do!
